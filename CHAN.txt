Tasks: Cloned the repository and created the index.php, video_store.sql, delete.php files. Worked on index.php and currently has a functioning form that adds videos to the table and the categories drop box updates with each movie/category input. The delete.php deletes the entire table values and redirects to the index.php form page. The video_store.sql contains the CREATE TABLE query for the database. During this time, I also reviewed class lectures and reviewed outside resources.

Tasks: Continued working on index.php and included a style.css, update_status.php, and deleterow.php files to meet the requirements for table functions. The program works and meets most of the requirements. I still need to clean up the codes and remove some comments and php/mysqli error codes for requirement purposes. This will be accomplished in the next work session. I also reviewed some outside resources to code the new elements of the table functions.

Tasks: Cleaned up the codes in all pages which included removing unnecessary comments and error code implements. Also went through the rough testing protocol to see if everything was working.
