Tasks: Cloned the repository and created the index.php, video_store.sql, delete.php files. Worked on index.php and currently has a functioning form that adds videos to the table and the categories drop box updates with each movie/category input. The delete.php deletes the entire table values and redirects to the index.php form page. The video_store.sql contains the CREATE TABLE query for the database. During this time, I also reviewed class lectures and reviewed outside resources.
